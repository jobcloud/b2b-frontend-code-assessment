# Angular Coding Challenge

This challenge is designed to test your skills in Angular.

## Challenge

Build an Angular application that allows users to create, edit, and delete job ads. 
The application should use the following technologies and concepts :

- Angular
- NgRx
- RxJS
- Observables
- Resources (bonus)
- ViewModels (bonus)
- NgRx Component Store (bonus)

The application should have the following features:

- **Create new job ads:** The user should be able to create new job ads by providing the following information: title, description, skills, and status.
- **Edit existing job ads:** The user should be able to edit existing job ads by changing any of the information that was provided when the job ad was created.
- **Filter job ads:** The user should be able to filter job ads by title, description, skill and status.
- **Delete job ads:** The user should be able to delete existing job ads.
- **Change the status of a job ad:** The user should be able to change the status of a job ad from `draft` to `published` or from `published` to `archived`.
- **List invoices:** The user should be able to list the invoices.
- When a job ad is published, an invoice should be created.
- The application should be fully responsive, no need to make it shiny but at least usable.

Here are some additional details :

- The `title`, `description`, and `skills` of a job ad are required fields.
- The status of a job ad can be one of three values: `draft`, `published`, or `archived`.
- When a job ad is deleted, all of its related data, such as the invoice, should also be deleted.
- The due date of an invoice is calculated based on the date the job ad was published and the current month. For example, if a job ad is published on February 15, 2023, the due date of the invoice will be April 30, 2023.
- The amount of the invoice is up to you.

## Bonus features

- Use a resource to fetch and update the job ads data.
- Use a view model to display the job ads data.
- Use the NgRx Component Store to store data that is specific to a component.
- Write unit tests for the application.

## Instructions

To complete this challenge, you will need to:

1. Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.
2. Implement the features described above using Angular, NgRx, and RxJS.
3. Use the provided [db.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobcloud/b2b-frontend-code-assessment/master/db.json) file to mock the backend using `json-server`.
4. Make sure the application is fully responsive.
5. Implement the bonus features if you have time.
6. Write unit tests for the application.
7. Submit your solution by sharing the GitHub repository link.
8. Provide instructions on how to run the application and tests.
9. Provide any additional information you think is relevant.
10. Have fun!

## Interfaces

```
interface JobAd {
  id: number;
  /**
   * Title of a job ad. Required property.
   * It's not allowed to have two job ads with the same title.
   */
  title: string;
  /**
   * Description of a job ad. Required property.
   * Its length should not be less than 10 characters.
   */
  description: string;
  /**
   * List of skills required for a job ad.
   */
  skills: string[];
  /**
   * When a job ad has a "draft" status, it can be switched to "published" or "archived".
   * When a job ad has a "published" status, it can be only switched to "archived".
   * When a job ad has an "archived" status, it cannot be updated.
   */
  status: JobAdStatus;
}

export type JobAdStatus = 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived';

interface Invoice {
  id: number;
  jobAdId: number;
  amount: unknown; // up to you
  dueDate: Date;
}

interface JobAdDto extends JobAd {
  // DTO properties that are not part of the model
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  _embedded: unknown;
}

interface InvoiceDto extends Invoice {
  // DTO properties that are not part of the model
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  _embedded: unknown;
}

```

The `JobAd` interface defines the properties of a job ad. The `title` and `description` properties are required. The `skills` property is an array of strings. The `status` property can be one of three values: `draft`, `published`, or `archived`.

The `Invoice` interface defines the properties of an invoice. The `jobAdId` property is the ID of the job ad that the invoice is for. The `amount` property is the amount of money due. The `dueDate` property is the date by which the invoice is due.

The `JobAdDto` and `InvoiceDto` interfaces extend the `JobAd` and `Invoice` interfaces, respectively, and add properties that are not part of the model. These properties are used to store additional information about the job ad or invoice, such as the creation and update dates.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Other Angular related development is welcome, such as using Angular Material or Angular Flex Layout.
Other technologies and languages, such as Docker and Node (or PHP), will not be taken into consideration.

## Evaluation criteria

The application will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- The use of Angular best practices.
- The use of NgRx to manage the state of the application.
- The use of RxJS and Observables to handle asynchronous operations.
- The quality of the code.
- The completeness of the features.
- The ability to trigger an invoice for each job ad publication. (bonus)
- The use of a view model in the component. (bonus)
- The use of a ngrx component store. (bonus)
- The use of a resource to fetch and update the job ads data. (bonus)

We hope you enjoy this challenge!
