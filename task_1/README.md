# Task 1: Code Quality

1. Take a look at the `file1.ts`:
    loadSongs action is dispatched if songs are not already loaded:
    We don't want to perform side effects in the component, how would you refactor it?

2. Take a look at the `file2.ts`:
    Preventing multiple API calls:
    How many times API call to get users will be triggered here? How to prevent that?

3. Take a look at the `file3.ts`:
    Do a code review and refactor if necessary.

4. Do you know any other methodology, tools or workflows than code reviews to help getting  maximum impact on Code Quality? What would you use or expect on a bigger project with multiple devs working on the same project and why?
